Kinwise AI Readiness Pulse
An interactive web application designed to help leaders in schools, non-profits, and businesses reflect on their organization's journey toward adopting new AI tools with a human-first approach.

üöÄ A Human-First Approach to AI
This isn't a technical test. It's a tool for reflection, built on the principle that any AI you use should be:

Helpful: Supports people and goals, not busywork.

Fair: Treats everyone equitably and reduces bias.

Clear: No "black-box" systems; you can explain the "why" in plain words.

Accountable: You set the rules and own the outcomes.

‚ú® What It Measures
The assessment guides users through six core domains of AI readiness, with questions tailored for either Districts/Schools or Businesses/Non-profits.

The six domains are:

Vision & Purpose: Is there a clear "why" for AI that aligns with your mission?

Policy & Governance: Are the rules of the road clear to keep AI use responsible?

Data, Privacy & Security: Are you protecting sensitive information and staying compliant?

Technology & Tools: Are your AI tools purposeful, safe, and delivering value?

People, Skills, & Culture: Are your people confident, trained, and sharing wins?

Human-Centered Impact: Is AI improving outcomes while honoring your organization's values?

üí° How It Works
The user selects their organization type (Education or Business/Non-profit).

They answer a series of questions, choosing the stage that feels most true for them today (Nascent, Emerging, Practicing, Flourishing).

Upon submission, a score is calculated, and a readiness level is determined (e.g., "Early Roots," "Growing Canopy," "Bearing Fruit," "Thriving Ecosystem").

The final result and readiness level are displayed to the user.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project was "vibe coded" with a focus on simplicity and speed, using:

HTML: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: For modern, responsive styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all the logic, including conditional questions, scoring, and displaying results.

This project is designed to be deployed live using GitHub Pages.
